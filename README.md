# Design
The game has a vintage christmas theme enjoyable for young and old

## Colour Scheme
<img src="assets/images/adobe_christmas_palette.png" width="600px"> \
I used [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to generate a classic, vintage christmas look.

## Typography
- I took inspiration from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/franchise-fonts/) for my font pairing of Limelight and Roboto. Limelight a classic art deco style font and roboto a simple sans serif font.
- Both fonts are found on [Googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I decided to use roboto in thin 100 variable
