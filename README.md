## Colour Scheme
<img src="assets/images/adobe_christmas_palette.png" width="600px"> \
I used [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to generate a classic, vintage christmas look.

## Typography
- Limelight is a classic art deco style font 
- Josefin sans is an elegant, vintage sans serif font
- Both fonts are found on [Googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I decided to use roboto in thin 100 variable
